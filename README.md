# airbnb-clone-project

## Airbnb Clone - Backend

##  Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. It supports various functionalities that mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

---

##  Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Add, update, and retrieve property listings.
- **Booking System**: Reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle secure transactions and record payment information.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave feedback and ratings.
- **Data Optimization**: Efficient data retrieval through optimized database queries and caching.

---

##  Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Implements RESTful and GraphQL APIs, manages business logic and code structure.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and maintains database schema, relationships, indexing, and performance tuning.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, monitoring, and scaling.
- **QA Engineer**: Writes and executes test cases to ensure reliability, performance, and security compliance.

---

##  Technology Stack

- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for building APIs.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Simplifies RESTful API development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing all backend data.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible and efficient API query language.
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks like email notifications and payment processing.
- **Redis**: Used for caching, task queueing, and session management.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environment across development and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for testing and deployment.

##  Database Design

### Entities & Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
- **Properties**
  - `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`
- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `timestamp`

### Relationships

- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (as a Host).
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** for a **Property**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to a **Booking**.

---

##  Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Handles user signup, login, and role-based access (guest/host).
- **Property Management**: Allows hosts to manage their listings (CRUD operations).
- **Booking System**: Enables users to book available properties and track booking status.
- **Payment Processing**: Securely handles transactions and tracks payment history.
- **Review System**: Lets users rate and review properties after booking.
- **Data Optimization**: Indexes and caching to improve response times and reduce server load.

---

##  API Security

- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT tokens for secure user sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions—only hosts can create properties, only guests can book.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting repeated API access (via DRF throttling or middleware).
- **Input Validation**: Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and bad data inputs.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures all communication between client and server is encrypted.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically runs tests (e.g., Pytest, Django TestSuite) on each push using GitHub Actions.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Deploys latest successful build to production/staging environments using Docker.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions** for pipeline automation.
  - **Docker & Docker Compose** for container management.
  - **Heroku / Render / AWS EC2** (optional) for deployment.
